## Getting Started

First you'll want to grab the project's source code,

```console

```

Now you should be able to build everything and start the runner program,

```console
$ cargo build --all --exclude dashboard

```

> **Note:** You need to `exclude` the `dashboard` project when compiling with
> `--all`. The `dashboard` crate is only designed to compile as WASM.

You'll need `cargo-web` To view the dashboard,

```console
$ cargo install cargo-web
```

And now you can run the dev server,

```console
$ cd dashboard
$ cargo web start --open
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s
    Processing "main.wasm"...
    Finished processing of "main.wasm"!

If you need to serve any extra files put them in the 'static' directory
in the root of your crate; they will be served alongside your application.
You can also put a 'static' directory in your 'src' directory.

Your application is being served at '/main.js'. It will be automatically
rebuilt if you make any changes in your code.

You can access the web server at `http://[::1]:8000`.
